## When should I use rebase?
- Never use rebase on a public branch
- Prefer rebase over merge when working on a feature branch or private branch
  
- Cherry-pick is used to pick a commit from one branch and apply it to another branch
- -- reset hard will delete all the changes in the working directory even stagging area
- -- rest soft won't do that.
